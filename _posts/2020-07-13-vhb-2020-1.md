>We will be solving a vulnhub challenge “BROKEN_2020” , this has a beginner level user flag and intermidiate level root flag.it is a linux based machine and we can use some basic pentesting skills to compromise into this VM.


## Reconnaissance

So lets start off with the very first step i.e. discovering the IP of machine using
netdiscover.

![img1]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/VulnhubBroken2020/1.png" | relative_url }})

Then we will start scanning for open port and services using nmap.

![img2]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/VulnhubBroken2020/2.png" | relative_url }})

we got two ports open,
port 80 – HTTP
port 22 – SSH

## Enumeration

We will go with port 80, and will start enumerating

![img3]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/VulnhubBroken2020/3.png" | relative_url }})

This html page has nothing and we cant do anything with it, so we will be
bruteforcing directories.

![img4]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/VulnhubBroken2020/4.png" | relative_url }})

Dirbuster results showed file named /cms/index.php and we searched for it.

![img5]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/VulnhubBroken2020/5.png" | relative_url }})

We got this CMS installation page.

I tried enumerating for cms but found nothing and so i clicked on install and it
took us to next page

![img6]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/VulnhubBroken2020/6.png" | relative_url }})

After clicking on “go here” it showed our main index page.

![img7]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/VulnhubBroken2020/7.png" | relative_url }})

our Index.php was hacked, so i went back to cms directory to enumerate more
and there i got our first flag.

![img8]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/VulnhubBroken2020/8.png" | relative_url }})

Now running a dirbuster scan again on cms gives us another directory named
“/cms/cc”.

![img9]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/VulnhubBroken2020/9.png" | relative_url }})

## Exploitation

C&C is an infrastructure which is used to carry out remote communication with
the hosts, they are used by attackers to maintain comunication with
compromised system, in a target network.
And here it is asking for ip and port, so we will try entering our ip and port, and
to know what is going on in background we can start a local HTTP server using
python.

![img10]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/VulnhubBroken2020/10.png" | relative_url }})
![img11]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/VulnhubBroken2020/11.png" | relative_url }})

Over here we can notice that it is trying to get some bash script file from our
local server, so we can try to create a file in our machine, with the python
oneliner reverse shell command then we will start our netcat listener and again
press on hack button.

![img12]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/VulnhubBroken2020/12.png" | relative_url }})\

And here we go we have our reverse shell!!
now we can start enumerating it, after some time i found our second flag in
/home/alice

![img13]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/VulnhubBroken2020/13.png" | relative_url }})

![img14]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/VulnhubBroken2020/14.png" | relative_url }})

## Post exploitation

After flag 2 we also had a note.txt for alice,
It says do not install TrustMeCMS, which we already installed, It also says that
script is created to clear apache log during the test, so in alice folder we can see
directory called script, and this script consist of two files log.py and clear.log,
after looking over the permisions of these files we can see that the script is
writeable

![img15]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/VulnhubBroken2020/15.png" | relative_url }})

![img16]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/VulnhubBroken2020/16.png" | relative_url }})

So we will add our own log.py file which will contain the reverse shell,
We moved log.py to another file lgp.py and copied our log.py into the machine. 

![img17]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/VulnhubBroken2020/17.png" | relative_url }})

now we will start our netcat listner and after few minutes we will get the root.
There is nothing much to explore in the root so we will move back to alice and
here we can see we got one new file named backup. As we open the file we will
find our third flag.

![img18]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/VulnhubBroken2020/18.png" | relative_url }})

Now we have our third flag and new note to alice which says to put the path of
the backup directoy into path.txt
so i tried echo“/home/alice/backup” > path.txt
but it copied it to alice backup folder, and as our challenge was to find the root
flag, so we can put /root/ into the path.txt and it will copy the files of root folder
to alice backup folder.
After waiting for few minutes, finally we got our root flag!!!

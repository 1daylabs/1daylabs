Let's begin the journey of exploiting the box. It's an easy windows box with 20 points. We will be utilizing some of the tools such as [EvilWinRm](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm) , [GetNPUsers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/master/examples/GetNPUsers.py) , winPEAS , and mimikatz.exe and secretdump.py for privilege escalation.


# **Enumeration**

We would be running [nmapAutomator](https://github.com/21y4d/nmapAutomator) tool which would cover all types of basic enumeration.

```console
./nmapAutomator 10.10.10.175 All
```

The result is as below

```console
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.175
Host is up (0.30s latency).

There are a bunch ports open lets list down the ports which would be useful in exploiting the box. There is Web server running at port 80. We have kerberos service running at port 389 and 3268 .We also got the domain name which got revealed by ldap service EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL .

I moved on to enumerating with enum4linux but didn't find any usernames. We even tried enumerating the SMB but didn't found something interesting .

As we got the HTTP port open lets enumerate the website.

![img2]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/sauna/2.png" | relative_url }})

After visiting the website found some user names in the "About-us"

![img3]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/sauna/3.png" | relative_url }})

Let's take a note of the usernames with a type of combination which would help us in enumeration during the ldap and kerberos. Below is the format in which we could form the user.txt.

![img4]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/sauna/4.png" | relative_url }})

After getting some usernames. We would be using the Impacket tool which has a GetNPUsers python script that returns the TGT(Ticket Granting Ticket) only if the user account doesn't need kerberos per-authentication.


# **Exploitation**

Now we would run the GetNPUsers.py against the domain name which will give us the TGT for the user FSmith.

```console
$ python3 GetNPUsers.py EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL/ -usersfile user.txt -outputfile tgt.txt -dc-ip 10.10.10.175
```
![img5]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/sauna/5.png" | relative_url }})

![img6]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/sauna/6.png" | relative_url }})

After cracking the hash with john using rockyou.txt file we achieved the password for

>FSmith : Thestrokes23

![img7]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/sauna/7.png" | relative_url }})

Now we will login using evil-winrm.

![img8]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/sauna/8.png" | relative_url }})

After logging in as FSmith we got the user.txt file. Now lets move on to the post-exploitation.

![img9]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/sauna/9.png" | relative_url }})


# **Post-Exploitation**

Let us first list down the users present .

![img10]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/sauna/10.png" | relative_url }})

The method is to use "winPEAS.exe" to collect information and get the password of svc_loanmgr and as we got DPAPI Master key which we could attack with mimikatz.

![img11]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/sauna/11.png" | relative_url }})

Then execute the winPEAS.exe file . Below are some interesting finding.

![img12]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/sauna/12.png" | relative_url }})

Now we have got the default password for svc_loanmgr user .

In the results of ./winPEAS.exe we got DPAPI master key which we could attack with mimikatz.

Lets dump the hashes by [secretsdump.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/secretsdump.py)

```console
$ python3 secretsdump.py EGOTISTICAL-BANK/svc-loanmgr@10.10.10.175
```

![img13]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/sauna/13.png" | relative_url }})

Now lets use the Administrator hash to get logged in using the [psexec.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/psexec.py)


```console
$ python3 python3 psexec.py -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:d9485863c1e9e05851aa40cbb4ab9dff Administrator@10.10.10.175
```

![img14]({{ "/assets/img/Posts/sauna/14.png" | relative_url }})

Bingo we have successfully rooted the box .
